# Swift Language Resource

**Some background on Swift as a language:**

The tone of the time was that the original iPhone was successful because of Objective-C and doing a new language was not obvious. Being an extension of C, Objective-C is not memory safe and difficult to learn as a language with many sharp edges. Memory safety was one of the big problems, but dealing with that would mean changing the reliance on pointers. Simply put, it wouldn't be Objective-C anymore. Chris Lattner started work on Swift in July of 2010. A few other folks started contributing in earnest late in 2011, and it became a major focus for the Apple Developer Tools group in July 2013.

**Some notes on design decisions:**

Swift is not just a statically compiled language, but can also be dynamically compiled or interpreted. The layering of Swift makes this possible. Furthermore on the UI side of things, Swift has this concept of "progressive disclosure of complexity" or "factoring of complexity" which also was a key point in its design and is not very typical for compiled languages.
